Configure TIM6 to generate periodic interrupt after every 3 seconds.
When Timer interrupt arrives, On led PD.13 and start the ADC1 
to process reading of channel 0. Generate ADC interrupt when 
conversion is completed.When ADC interrupt arrives, On ledn PD.14 
and send the ADC reading on USART2. Generate UART interrupt for 
transmission completion. When UART interrupt arrives, Toggle led 
PD.15 and then clear PD.13 and PD.14 Leds. Keep PD12 toggling 
after every 500 ms using TIM7 interrupt.
