 EM Waves are used to transfer data from sender to receiver

Personal Area Network
§ Smallest network which is very personal to the user
§ E.g. BlueTooth

§ Local Area Network
§ Spans across building(s) and operated under single administrative system
§ E.g. company, school network
§ Technologies: TokenRing or Ethernet

§ Metropolitan Area Network
§ Spans across cities
§ E.g. cable network
§ Technologies: high speed fiber optics

§ Wide Area Network
§ Spans across countries
§ Technologies: ATM, Frame Relay

Physical arrangement of computers is known as topology
§ Famous topologies
§ Bus
§ Ring
§ Star
§ Mesh

Layered architecture having 7 layers

§ HTTP [80]: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
§ HTTPs [443]: Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
§ FTP [20, 21]: File Transfer Protocol
§ SFTP [115]: Simple FTP
§ DNS [53]: Domain Name Service
§ NFS [1023]: Network File System
§ POP3 [110]: Post Office Protocol
§ SMTP [25]: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
§ SSH [22]: Secure Shell
§ LDAP [389]: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

Presentation Layer
§ Serves as the data translator for the network
§ Also known as syntax layer
§ Responsible for
§ Translation
§ Compression/Decompression
§ Encoding/Decoding
§ Encryption/Decryption

Session Layer
§ Provides mechanism for opening, closing and managing session between processes
§ Communication sessions consist of requests and responses that occur between applications
§ Protocols
§ ASP: AppleTalk Session Protocol
§ ADSP: AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol
§ NetBIOS: Network BIOS
§ PAP: Password Authentication Protocol
§ PPTP: Point to Point Tunnelling Protocol
§ RPC: Remote Procedure Call
§ SCP: Session Control Protocol
§ SDP: Socket Direct Protocol
--
SIP : session Initiation Protocol

Transport Layer
§ Provide host-to-host communication services for applications
§ Creates Segment (data unit) containing
§ Sequence number
§ Checksum
§ Port number

§ Protocols
§ TCP
§ Connection oriented protocol
§ Provides: Flow Control, Error checking
§ Guarantees data delivery
§ Slower than UDP
§ E.g. WWW, HTTP
§ UDP
§ Connectionless protocol
§ Does not provide flow control
§ Does not guarantee data delivery
§ Faster than TCP
§ E.g. streaming, online games

Network Layer
§ Responsible for packet forwarding including routing through
intermediate routers
§ Responsible for splitting segment into packets containing
§ Source IP address
§ Destination IP address
§ Protocols
§ IP: Internet Protocol
§ IPX: Internetwork Packet Exchange
§ IPSec: Internet Protocol Security
§ EGP: Exterior Gateway Protocol
Devices: used to form wan

Data Link Layer
§ Transfers data between
§ adjacent network nodes in a wide area network (WAN) or
§ between nodes on the same local area network (LAN) segment
§ Encapsulates packet into Frames containing
§ Source MAC Address
§ Destination MAC Address
§ Sublayers
§ Logical Link Layer
§ Media Access Control Layer

Data Link Layer: Logical Link Layer
§ The uppermost sublayer multiplexes protocols running at the top of data link layer, and optionally
provides flow control, acknowledgment, and error notification
§ Provides addressing and control of the data link
§ Services
§ Error control (automatic repeat request, ARQ)
§ Flow control [Data-link-layer flow control is not used in LAN protocols such as Ethernet, but in modems and
wireless networks]

Data Link Layer: Media Access Control Layer
§ Refers to the sublayer that determines who is allowed to access the media at any one time
(CSMA/CD)
§ Determines where one frame of data ends and the next one starts (frame synchronization)
§ Frame synchronization uses: time based, character counting, byte stuffing and bit stuffing.
§ Services
§ Multiple access protocols for channel-access control,
§ CSMA/CD protocols for collision detection and re-transmission in Ethernet networks
§ CSMA/CA protocol for collision avoidance in wireless networks
§ Physical addressing (MAC addressing)
§ LAN switching (packet switching), including MAC filtering, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and Shortest Path
Bridging (SPB)
§ Data packet queuing or scheduling

Addressing Modes: MAC Address
§ Used to identify NIC uniquely
§ Consists of 6 bytes [48 bits]
§ First 3 bytes represents manufacturer
§ Next 3 bytes represents NIC’s unique address 

MAC:-
 physical address
->read- only address
→ data link layers address
→ real address
