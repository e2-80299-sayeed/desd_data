Theory Questions
1: OOP-8. What is function overloading? Which are the rules of function overloading? Why return type 
is not considered in function overloading?  
2: oop-2:What are advantages of Object Oriented Programming?

Question 1:
Define a struct in C for bank account information details
struct members
	name,
	acountnumber,
	acounttype,  [saving/loan/ppf/nps]
	balance  [minimun balance = 1000]
functions
	AcceptData()
	Deposit()
	Withdraw()

in main function test the functionality by using menu driven code
------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2:

Define a struct in C for to save time 
struct members

Time struct
int hr,min,sec
initTime()    ->0:0:0
acceptTime()
DisplayTime()
increamentTimeBy1Min()


3> Write a .cpp file having a employee struct contains
empID,empName,empSalary,and two function AcceptData and 
printDate . and call these function in main()

//function overloading
4) write a function 'Add' which is able to add 
3 int value and 1 float value 
2 int value and 2 float value ,
1 int value and 3 float value,
4 int value ,
4 float value,

//default argument
5> write a function that has the default values for multiple parameters. 
Call the function where the parameters will use the default values 
and where the values will be passed to
 the function.

//inline functiom

6> Write a inline function to calculate area of triangle.
Input base and Height from user and print the result.
